              <p className="text-xl mt-4 text-gray-600">
              Tooth extractions may be required for a variety of reasons. The most common reason is severe tooth decay that cannot be treated with a filling, crown or root canal therapy. Other situations include damage from trauma, overcrowding or impacted wisdom teeth that threaten the health of surrounding teeth. In each case, our skilled dentist and team carefully evaluate the patientâ€™s condition to determine whether an extraction is the best solution.

              <p className="text-xl mt-4 text-gray-600">
              The thought of having a tooth extracted may cause anxiety, but the process is typically straightforward and painless. The procedure begins with the administration of local anesthesia to numb the area around the tooth. For more complex extractions, such as impacted teeth, sedation may be recommended. We will then gently remove the tooth, ensuring minimal discomfort for the patient.
After the extraction, the healing process is carefully monitored, and patients are given detailed aftercare instructions to ensure proper recovery.
