              A dental filling is a restoration used to repair minor to moderate tooth damage. We may recommend a filling if a tooth has been damaged by decay (for example, if it has a cavity) or suffers from minor fracturing or chipping. The dental filling is used to restore the tooth to its original structure and function, and return your smile to good health. There are two main types of dental fillings available: amalgam fillings and composite fillings.

              The process for placing a dental filling requires just one comfortable visit to our office. Our dentist will first remove the decayed and damaged portion of the tooth, then clean it to remove all traces of decay. We then fill the area with the filling material and shape it to match your toothâ€™s shape. Finally, the filling is hardened by our dentist for a lasting restoration.
