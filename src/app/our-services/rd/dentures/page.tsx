              <p className="text-xl mt-4 text-gray-600">
              Dentures are removable prosthetic devices designed to replace missing teeth. They are custom-made to fit each patientâ€™s mouth, ensuring comfort and a natural appearance. There are two main types of dentures: complete dentures, which replace all the teeth in either the upper or lower jaw, and partial dentures, which replace a few missing teeth while preserving the remaining natural teeth. Dr. Jayashree Thorat will assess your specific needs and guide you in choosing the best option for your situation.

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
              <li>Complete Dentures: These are used when all teeth are missing. They rest directly on the gums and are made to fit securely in the mouth.</li>
              <li>Partial Dentures: Designed for patients with some remaining natural teeth, partial dentures use a metal framework or clasps to stay in place.</li>
              <li>Immediate Dentures: Placed immediately after teeth extraction, allowing patients to have dentures while their gums heal.</li>
              <li>Implant-Supported Dentures: For added stability, dental implants can be used to secure dentures in place, providing a more permanent and secure fit.</li>
              </ul>
